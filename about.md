Now is an exciting time in the legal community. So much is changing. So much new opportunity exists for those eager to understand, embrace and participate in change.

That's not easy though, in part because it's too hard to follow what's going on. We have lots of blog posts, tweets, product reviews and press releases, but very few helpful resources. Hopefully that's what this site will become.

Law Inno is collaborative, open source and very much a work-in-progress.

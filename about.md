Now is an exciting and uncertain time to work in law. If you're in the early or middle stages of your career, like me, it's hard to resist the sense that what you expected from a law career is not what you'll get.

That's not all bad. For me personally, it feels more like opportunity than limitation, or disappointment. But for many it's [deeply troubling](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/business/dealbook/burdened-with-debt-law-school-graduates-struggle-in-job-market.html?_r=0). For those struggling to work off big debts, a chasm exists between promise and reality.

What's certain is that disregarding change is not a viable plan. That doesn't mean you have to embrace all of it. I'm a deep skeptic of [litigation crowdfunding](https://medium.com/@abziegler/justice-is-not-an-asset-class-f7bac77b3f96), for instance, but I can't deny that it exists. On the other hand, I believe wholeheartedly in the potential for [online collaboration](https://www.mootus.com) to transform the quality and accessibility of legal services.

If denial is not a viable approach, the only reasonable alternative is exploring, understanding and participating in change. That's not easy, I've found, in part because we have no clearinghouse of [ideas](/ideas/) or information about [what and who](/actors/) are influencing the future of law. We have endless blog posts, tweets, product reviews and press releases, but very few helpful resources. That's what I hope this site can become.

A final note - this site is collaborative, open source and very much a work-in-progress. Through [Github](https://github.com/lawinno/lawinno.github.io) you can propose additions, edits and other changes. You can [ask questions and report bugs](https://github.com/lawinno/lawinno.github.io/issues). You can take the code and the content and do what you like: copy it, remix it, improve it, even sell it (with attribution, of course!). I'd be thrilled if any of that happens.
